<h3>Description</h3>
<p><p>Let N1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 1000} (the set of all positive integers between 1 and 1000, inclusive).<br />Delete every second number in N1. The result is N2 = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, ..., 999}.<br />Delete every third number in N2. The result is N3 = {1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 19, 21, 25, ..., 999}.<br />Delete every fourth number in N3. The result is N4 = {1, 3, 7, 13, 15, 19, 25, 27, ...}.<br />...<br />Delete every tenth number in N9. The result is N10. Find the n-th element of sequence N10, where n is a 1-based index.</p></p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p><p>First line a positive number t indicate the test case number.<br />Following t lines, each line contains a number n ( 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 100 ).</p></p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p><p>For each test case, output the the n-th element of sequence N10.</p></p>
