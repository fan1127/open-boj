<h3>Description</h3>
<p><p>Due to historical reasons people measure temperature in different scales, such as Fahrenheit and Celsius. Your task is to convert a temperature from one scale to another. It is known that both scales are linear with respect to each other (i.e., there are real numbers a and b such that temperature t presented in the first scale can be converted to the second by the law t'=a*t+b).</p><p>You are given 5 ints: f1, the freezing point of water in the first scale; b1, the boiling point of water in the first scale; f2, the freezing point of water in the second scale; b2, the boiling point of water in the second scale; and t, the temperature in the first scale. Output t converted into the second scale.</p><p>Because the boiling and the freezing points of water depend on the atmospheric pressure, you may assume that both the scales are under the same circumstances.</p></p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p><p>First line a positive number t indicate the test case number.<br />Following t lines, each line contains 5 numbers f1, b1, f2, b2, t<br />f1,b1,f2,b2 and t will each be between -1000 and 1000, inclusive.<br />f1 will be less than b1.<br />f2 will be less than b2.</p></p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p><p>For each test case, output t converted into the second scale.<br />Round the numbers in the output to 3 digits after decimal point.</p></p>
